Purpose 

markUp is based on the markItUp! jQuery plugin by Jay Salvat (http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/). It provides a simple html text editor for those of us who want the productivity improvements of not having to type in all our own html tags, but don't want to use a wysiwyg editor. 

Out of the box markUp provides easy insertion of all header tags, paragraphs, unordered and ordered lists, images, and links.
